## What is it?
We have designed a fun little application that will present movie or tv show information, and related gifs (giphs?) to the user about the movie or TV show. 

## Why did we make this?
We wanted to bring more of a comical stand point to the user when they go to search for information on a movie or TV show, whether it would be it's runtime, ratings or when it originally came out, and present them with a varied selection of gifs that correspond to the user's query.

## How did we go about building this?
We worked pretty hard (especially those of us that did the JavaScript) to bring this application to life. 
We first needed some API's that would give us the data we were looking for, then find ways to get them to work as we intended. Some of the functionality was difficult to process, but we came together with our combined knowledge and got it up and running!

The first API we used / choose for this application was the OMBd API, which can be found here: https://www.omdbapi.com/ . 
The second API we used / choose was the Giphy API, which can be found here:
https://developers.giphy.com/ .

Other helpfull features of Javascript are DOM hooks and local storage.

We also made use of the Bulma CSS Framework. It was a small learning curve in comparison to BootStrap, but in the end had very similar functionality, just different Syntax.
